# 👋 Welcome

I’m Jeremy — an educator, technologist, and newly certified Security+ professional building a career in cybersecurity and IT support. My work blends analysis, troubleshooting, creative coding, and hands-on security practice. I document everything in my [cyber_journal](https://github.com/jeremyrayjewell/cyber_journal) to show real process, not just polished results.

I currently teach ESL remotely while developing the experience and portfolio to transition into remote U.S. help desk, security operations, and analyst roles.

# 🚀 Current Focus

I concentrate on strengthening foundational security and IT support skills through hands-on practice. My work includes security operations fundamentals, log analysis, endpoint troubleshooting, Linux workflows, scripting, virtualization, and small-scale incident response exercises. I maintain an active home lab and document structured learning in GitHub for clarity and accountability.

# 📊 Impact & Achievements

I have completed multiple structured cybersecurity programs, built a home lab from scratch, and maintained a “learning in public” portfolio documenting real progress and technical growth. I routinely integrate IT support tasks, scripting, SIEM workflows, and troubleshooting practice into my study pipeline. My Security+ certification now anchors this trajectory with validated credentials.
