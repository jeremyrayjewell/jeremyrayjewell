# 👋 Welcome!
Hi, I’m Jeremy — educator, writer, and technologist building a career in cybersecurity.  
📚 From philosophy and teaching to packet captures and pentesting, I’ve turned curiosity into a full-stack learning journey.  
🔐 I document everything in my [cyber_journal](https://github.com/jeremyrayjewell/cyber_journal) to show my process, not just the results.  
🧑‍💻 Currently teaching ESL remotely while building the skills and portfolio for my first SOC role.
